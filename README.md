## About

This is a collection of tools useful for combinatorics, number theory and other areas of maths.

## Goals

* Learn to work with gmp, mpfr and c++ templates.
* Explore different approaches on computing different mathematical functions faster.

## Features

* Sequence generators.
* Calculations.
* Approximations.
* C++ headers with compile-time definitions.

### Keywords

* Narcissistic numbers
* Figurate numbers
* Fibonacci
* Factorial
* Euclid numbers
* Binomial coefficient
* Derangements
* Catalan
* Stirling 1, 2
* Eulerian 1, 2
* Pi digits
* E digits
* Natural number partition
* Ackermann
* Palindromes
* Prime sieve
* Polynomial coefficient
* Binomial distribution
* Poisson distribution

## Build with

* cc, c++, make, bash
* gmp, mpfr, pthread, openmp

## Usage

To see what a particular program does, run

	cd src/
	make

and supply with enough arguments.

If you still don't know, what do some magic numbers generated by a program mean, have a look at the code, it might even have some comments in it, clarifying what is happening.

To clean up, do

	cd src
	make clean
