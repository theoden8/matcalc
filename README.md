Created by Kirill Rodriguez in 2016/08.

## About

This is a collection of tools useful for combinatorics, number theory and other areas of maths.

## Goals

* Learn to work with gmp, mpfr and c++ templates.
* Explore different approaches on computing different mathematical functions faster.

## Features

* Sequence generators.
* Calculations.
* Approximations.
* C++ headers with compile-time definitions.

### Keywords

* Figurate numbers
* Fibonacci
* Factorial
* Euclid numbers
* Binomial coefficient
* Derangements
* Catalan
* Stirling 1, 2
* Eulerian 1, 2
* Pi digits
* Natural number partition
* Ackermann
* Palindromes
* Prime sieve
* Polynomial coefficient

## Build with

* cc, c++, make, bash
* gmp, mpfr, pthread

## Usage

To see what a particular program does, run

	cd src/
	make

and supply with enough arguments.

If you still don't know, what do some magic numbers generated by a program mean, have a look at the code, it might even have some comments in it, clarifying what is happening.

To clean up, do

	cd src
	make clean

## License

## Measuring performance

	cd src
	make
	cd ../benchmark
	# ./benchmark program test1 test2 ..., e.g.
	./benchmark ../bin/_partition $(./geometric 15)

## Bugs and optimizations

If you find a problem, or optimization related to any of the programs/algorithms, do not hesitate posting an issue.
